# Mechanitor Control Range Extenders
This mod adds implants which increase a mechanitor's command range, by 5 per implant, up to a maximum of 55. The implants are split between the Standard Mechtech and High Mechtech research projects, with 3 levels of implants per research project. The implants cost the same resources as the control sublink implants.

Future plans include a structure which projects a command radius around it, but I have no timeline on when I'll be making that.

This mod is currently incompatible with my [Mechanitor Psy-Sensitive Control Range](https://github.com/Hydroxyapatite/Mechanitor-Psy-Sensitive-Control-Range) mod.
